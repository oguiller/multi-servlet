# Example of a multiple servlet application

This is an example of a multi servlet application. The goal was to create 2 different servlets to split the REST api 
from the Web application part.

A multiservlet application can be useful in cases where one of the parts of your applications need securtiy and the 
other does not.

In this case I only splitted the REST part from the WEB application.
